      <h2>Joy is a Sheltie</h2>
      <p>
        The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is an extremely
        intelligent, quick, and obedient herder from Scotland's remote and
        rugged Shetland Islands. Shelties bear a strong family resemblance to
        their bigger cousin, the Collie. The Shetland Sheepdog is a small,
        active, and agile herding dog standing between 13 and 16 inches at the
        shoulder. The long coat is harsh and straight, with a dense undercoat,
        and comes in black, blue merle, and sable, with white markings. The
        coat, along with a long, wedge-shaped head; small, three-quarter erect
        ears; and deep-chested, level-backed torso, give Shelties the look of a
        rough-coated Collie in miniature. Bright and eager Shelties are easy
        trainers and world-class competitors in obedience, agility, and herding
        trials. They are sensitive and affectionate family dogs, highly in tune
        with the mood of the household. They like to bark and tend to be
        reserved toward strangers two qualifications of an excellent watchdog.
